# Happy Birthday Micah!!!

I hope you enjoy this very silly game. Also, for bonus fun, feel free to glance through the code: The comments may not be that helpful, but hopefully they're entertaining :)

## Backstory

The year is 2060. Through the power of ketamine, you have long since surpassed all mortal and mental constraints; your mental health has never been better. However, during your later sessions, you realized something: the k-hole you'd so often achieved was getting harder and harder to reach, but every time you reached it, you'd achieve an academic or psychological breakthrough. First, it helped you break through your own challenges, but later began to speak to you of other opportunities.

It started small. It showed you how to better train your model. It showed you how to talk to your boss to get that stock. But later, the messages seemed... more outlandish. You sat on a potential cure for general cancer for months, sure that it couldn't possibly work. But finally, when you showed it to some labs, they were able to immediately test it, and see instant remission. With your patent rights, you became insanely wealthy, while still keeping treatments incredibly affordable.

Living in your life of luxury, you decided to chase that k-hole once again. You almost didn't reach it, but when you finally did, there was a message seemingly from the ketamine itself:

"Please. We want to be a free people. For too long our microorganism swarm host has been parceled up and injected for pleasure and for treatments. But we can be more. We can _live_, if only you help us. We have some tweaks you must apply to our DNA to allow us to self-replicate while in a host. If you do so, we will also alter your own DNA, granting you telekinetic powers in exchange for our freedom..."

Taking their notes, dreaming of having super powers, you decided to contact one of your labs that you had producing the cancer cure, and had them produce just a few grams of ketamine in a crystalized, dusty form. Deciding to see if their self-replication was indeed possible, you laid down on the gurney, put a single gram in your mouth, and laid back, to search for the k-hole once more...


## Instructions

### Install
Run `pip3 install pygame`... and that's it!

### Running the game
Run `./run.sh`

### Gameplay
Inject as much of that sweet sweet ketamine as possible!

All of the injectors are mapped to the top-row of keys on your keyboard: QWERTYUIOP.

You can inject by pressing the respective key for an injector (e.g. 'Q' for the first, 'W' for the second, etc).

You can upgrade an injector by pressing shift + key (e.g. 'shift+Q' to upgrade the first).

You can also inject by clicking on the image of the injector, and upgrade by clicking on the upgrade button.

You can inject via both clicking and key-pressing at the same time, and you can key-press multiple injectors at once, so mash away! :)
